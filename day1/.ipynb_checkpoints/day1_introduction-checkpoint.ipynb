Many aspects of the language help to enforce clarity. There is also a set of convensions, called the PEP 8 Style Guide, that most programmers have adopted in order to make their code as clear as possible. I recommend trying to follow PEP 8 as much as possible, if only to make your code easier to decipher when you come back to it after a year or two of disuse. "

One feature of Python that enables rapid prototyping is that it is an \"interpreted\" language: each line is executed by the Python \"interpreter\" one after the next. This is different than C, C++, or Java, which require that programs first be \"compiled\", i.e. translated in their entirety from code to byte code before they are run. "

Note how the menu above allows use to specify whether each cell is a \"code\" cell (i.e. contains Python code) or a markdown cell.
